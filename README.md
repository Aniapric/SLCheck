# SLCheck

SLCheck is a Linux shell script that detects broken symbolic links using
manual recursive directory traversal, without relying on external tools.

## Features
- Recursively scans directories and subdirectories
- Detects broken symbolic links
- Uses manual traversal logic (no `find`, `readlink`, or similar tools)
- Simple command-line interface

## Usage
Make the script executable (if not already):
```bash
chmod +x SLCheck.sh
